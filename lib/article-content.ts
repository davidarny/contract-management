    conclusion:
      'Terms and Conditions are essential legal documents that form the backbone of business-customer relationships in the digital age. They provide necessary legal protection while establishing clear expectations for all parties involved. While often seen as mere formalities by users, well-crafted Terms and Conditions serve as crucial safeguards that can prevent disputes, ensure compliance, and protect both businesses and consumers. As digital commerce continues to evolve, the importance of clear, fair, and legally sound Terms and Conditions only increases. Businesses should invest in creating comprehensive, user-friendly terms that balance legal protection with user experience, ensuring they serve their intended purpose while fostering trust and transparency with their users.',

For most of them, the FTC asserts, such an agreement restricts them from freely switching jobs, lowers wages, stifles innovation, blocks entrepreneurs from starting new businesses, and undermines fair competition.\n\nThe ban carves out an exception for existing non-competes for senior executives because these agreements are more likely to have been negotiated.
